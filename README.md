# study-script-deep
harder version of Study Script with best deep education potential of studying system programming more directly

compiler `new StudyScript()` -> `new StudyScript(config)` where are an information of virtual RAM, processor, etc. for best different emulation of hardware restrictions

`start` -> `start process <name>`

`finish` -> `finish kill proccess <name>`

`new <variable> <type>` -> `new ramN -> chipN -> cellN -> addressN bind <variable> <type>` where `N` is a different numbers of index of current detail 

`set <variable> <value>` -> `set <variable> binary <value>` now value from regular like `123` or `"hello"` converts into `123` -> `1111011` and `"hello"` -> `01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`
